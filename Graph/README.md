# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.



## Challenge

Implement the Graph with specific methods : 

  - addNode() 

  - addEdge()

  - getNodes()

  - getNeighbors()

  - size()



## Approach & Efficiency



## API


- addNode() => To add nodes to the Graph.

- addEdge() => Add edges to connect the nodes.

- getNodes() => Get a list of nodes after travsering the Graph.

- getNeighbors() => Get the neighbors of each node without duplicates.

- size() => Returns the size of the Graph based on the number of nodes.
